                        <li>Registration of students shall be only on the regular registration period indicated in the academic calendar; Provided, that this may be extended for grace period of five (5) working days                 after the last day of the registration schedule, subject to the approval of Vice President for Academic Affairs and upon payment of fine for late registration, as required.</li>
                        <li>A student shall be deemed officially registered in order to receive credit course work when he has paid his tuition and other school fees duly validated by the Admission and Records Office.</li>
                        <li>Registration of a returning student shall be dependent on previous scholastic standing; Provided, that an admission slip, clearance, and a certified copy of his transcript of records, among other things, shall be required as credentials for the enrollment.</li>
                        <li>A student shall not be allowed to enroll in more than one course at a time during his stay at the University.</li>
                        <li>The rules of sequencing of subjects in the curriculum of the course being taken must be observed and followed in enrollment. Enrolling and attendance in a subject without it passing its prerequisite shall earn the student no academic credit on the same.</li>
                        <li>In meritorious cases, however, a student who has previously enrolled and fully attended a course that is pre-requisite to another may be allowed to enroll and attend in the latter course for credit without having passed or earned credit for the prerequisite course; Provided, that no permission shall be granted on waiver of prerequisites except upon application by the student; and provided, that the application shall be accompanied by a certification from the studentâs instructors in the prerequisite course that the student had fully attended said course; and provided, furthermore, that the application shall be accompanied by a certification from the Director Of Student Affairs that the students failure to pass or earn credit in the prerequisite course was not due to disciplinary action imposed upon him.</li>
                        <li>The dean of the college/institute concerned shall authorized to grant the permission on waiver of prerequisite course/subject and shall act through a committee created by the dean, to include the college secretary, among others, to decide on the merit of the application.</li>
